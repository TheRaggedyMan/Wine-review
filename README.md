# Wine Review Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze wine reviews using advanced NLP techniques. By leveraging embeddings and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, we seek to uncover patterns, sentiments, and possibly predict the quality of wines based on their reviews.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

## Methodology

This project employs a combination of text embeddings and LSTM networks to process and analyze the textual data contained in wine reviews. This section outlines the approach taken, including data preprocessing, model training, and analysis.

### Embeddings + Model

We use pre-trained embeddings to convert text into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning. This vector representation allows us to utilize an LSTM model to understand the context and sentiment of each review.

### LSTM

Our LSTM network is tailored to sequence data, making it ideal for text analysis. This section should detail the network architecture, including the number of layers, hidden units, and any specific configurations crucial to the model's performance.
